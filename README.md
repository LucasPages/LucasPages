# Hey GitHub !

My name is **Lucas Pag√®s**, I'm a young Back-End developer based in Berlin. I currently work as a Django Dev and System Administrator for Hydro-Berlin.

I stand with Palestine and against israeli war crimes and the genocide in occupied Palestine :watermelon:

## My work

I am currently working primarily on a tenant-aware API - _and self-deploying it on a VPS_ - to manage data in the field of _Hydrogeology_, aka the study of ground water. I am primarily using Django Rest Framework and making use of `django-tenants` and `django-tenants-users` to make this happen.
